DFS
Depth First Search
General Stepsï¼š
    1. Initialize HashSet to record visited nodes
    2. For all entry nodes, call DFS():
        a. Validate current node, if visited or invalid or answer node, return.
        b. Do something (Pre-order)
        c. For each nerghbor node:
            i. Validate nerghbor node, if visited or invalid or answer node, don't recurse on it or return answer
            ii. Recurse down on nerghbor node -> DFS(nerghbor)
        d. Do something (Post-order)
